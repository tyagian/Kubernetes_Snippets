# Kubernetes Service Meshes with Istio

This is the code repository for [Kubernetes Service Meshes with Istio [Video]](), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course

Building microservice architectures is complex. Handling the involved complexities, like circuit breaking, rate limiting, observability or security, is usually left up to the development teams to implement. Using well known open source frameworks is an option, but this will quickly lead to excessive library bloat and suddenly your services are not quite so micro anymore. So you better put your microservice architectures on a service mesh diet!

This course provides practical hands-on experience on using the Istio service mesh. Instead of implementing cross cutting concerns within each service, you will see how a service mesh allows you to transparently inject and decorate the desired concerns into the individual communication channels.You will discuss the conceptual Istio architecture with its main building blocks and workings you need to know. The individual sections will then demonstrate how to install Istio and use its traffic management, resilience, diagnosability and security features.

By the end of this course you will be ready to deploy Istio in production to deploy and run your next cloud native microservice architecture.

## What will you learn

This course is packed with step-by-step instructions and realistic examples that are directly applicable in practice. The different sections of this course will focus on the important topics of deploying and running cloud-native applications such as traffic management and routing, rollout scenarios, resiliency, observability and security and how these are addressed by the Istio service mesh.

1. Explore the Istio architecture and its components
2. Install the Istio service mesh in Kubernetes using Helm and manually
3. Control ingress and egress traffic in the service mesh
4. Apply path, header and weight-based routing strategies
5. Perform Blue/Green and Canary deployments with Istio
6. Implement service resiliency using timeouts, circuit breakers, bulkheads and retries
7. Perform chaos testing by injecting faults and errors
8. Secure the service mesh with mutual TLS and authentication and authorization policies
9. Explore and leverage the diagnosability features of Istio
